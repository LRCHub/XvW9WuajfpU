These will be times that i will miss
Don't blame me if I don't come through
I've spent a lifetime on this
But I would give it all to you

'Cause I know what you do out of passion
But it only makes it harder for me
And I know that you're scared of the notion
We'll become who we meant to be

'Cause I know what you do out of passion
But it only makes it harder for me
And I know that you're scared of the notion
We'll become who we meant to be
